#Temperature Conversion 

#Overview
This Python code snippet demonstrates a simple temperature conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The code takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input, converts it to Celsius, and returns the converted value.

#Code Explanation
The code consists of the following steps:

Variable Initialization:

f is initialized as a float, which will store the input temperature in Fahrenheit.
Conversion to Celsius:

The input temperature in Fahrenheit (f) is converted to Celsius using the formula: (f - 32) * 5/9.
The result is stored in the variable c.
Return Statement:

The converted temperature in Celsius (c) is returned as the output of the convert function.
Function Call:

The code demonstrates the usage of the convert function by passing a Fahrenheit temperature value (in this case, 78) to it and then printing the result.
Usage
To use this code for temperature conversion, follow these steps:

Define the convert function in your Python script or module.

Call the convert function, passing the temperature in Fahrenheit as an argument.

The function will return the equivalent temperature in Celsius.
